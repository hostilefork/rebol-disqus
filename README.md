rebol-disqus
============

Disqus API wrapper for use with Rebol 3.  In a very primitive phase at the moment, and can only fetch thread IDs given a URL or post a comment (to a URL or a thread ID).

Documentation and features will hopefully be improving if more interest is generated.  Just putting it out there.  For now, you can read about the details at the blog entry: [Importing Comments with the Disqus API](http://blog.hostilefork.com/importing-comments-with-disqus-api/)
